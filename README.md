# Photography Portfolio

> I'll use this site to post mostly Street Photography and photos that I don't post on Unsplash due to their strict guidelines.

## How to run

Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Create an account on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and rename the `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` adding the keys you got from Cloudinary.

Upload some photos separated by folders and that's it!

## Contribute
